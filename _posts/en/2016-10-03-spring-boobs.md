Six years ago I developed an enterprise project with Spring framework.

We believed that Spring is a bloody enterprise.
 
We wanted to get rid of this boilerplate.

We were young and courage, we wanted changes.

<!--more-->

## And it began!

At year 2010 I got to Codeborne company where we got a freedom to use whatever tools we wanted.

I wanted a lot of very different tools.

Meanwhile I developed projects with:

* Struts2 (Java), 
* Play 1 framework (Java),
* Ruby (Sinatra),
* Scala (Scalatra), 
* Groovy,
* Python (Tornado framework),
* Kotlin,
* Ratpack,
* Vert.x,
* and even PHP! 

## And what now?

Disappointed with
* slow compilation Scala;
* Groovy scripts that are not supported well by any IDE; 
* dynamic Python that fails with any upgrade;
* annoying keyword `self.` that you must write in Python before every method call;
* Ruby that can be broken by single random comment line in single random dependency; 
* endless night debugging sessions with [unbelievably crazy Play framework bugs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wi3uLRlOWeU), 

I started to look for something stable.

Something that I could rely on.

Something that simply works. 

## And then... 

I decided to try Spring framework once again.

I decided to give it a chance.

And I found that 
 
* it contains no more boilerplate than Struts2 framework.
* it can reload classes on the fly **much better** than Play framework.
* it can log, save, and load data out of the box. With no bugs. With no issues. With no unexpected behaviour. With no black magic.
* it almost doesn't allow you to write spaghetti code because built-in architecture 
forces you to write good code: all these services, repositories, 
ideally implemented dependency injection - it's just impossible to make it bad.
* it does everything to allow you easily write automated tests.
  * Both unit-tests and integration. With just one command - runs database, tests your select and dies.
  * And even UI tests. With just one command - runs application with database, opens a browsers, clicks the buttons and dies. 
* and finally, it does not need any XML.  

Does anybody still remember what we didn't love Spring six years ago?

## Finally

Maybe I am just getting old, but now I am ready to say that Spring is the best framework in the world.
Better than anything that was created after it.
