title: Migration to Mockito 2.1
---

Recently we got a great news.

They released Mockito 2.1.0 - after so many years of hopeless waiting!

There is [a lot of cool updates](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/wiki/What%27s-new-in-Mockito-2) in Mockito 2, including:

* Support for Java 8
* Migration from CGLIB to [ByteBuddy](http://bytebuddy.net/)
* Mocking final classes and methods

Yes! I must use it! - I decided.

What a huge disappointment it was for me...

## Epic fail

I tried to upgrade my working project to Mockito 2.1.0, and ...
 ups.
 
I got over 100 red tests (from ~6000).

My first emotion was - what the hell! Mockito 2 sucks!

But the further investigation showed that Mockito 2 is cool, but some of my tests are bad.
The new Mockito found a whole bunch of problems in our tests.

Let's discover them together.

## What you need to do

Below you can find my tutorial for migration to Mockito 2.

Let's start!

### First, you will need to replace import

A lot of imports. In many files. Replace these lines:

```java
import static org.mockito.Matchers.any;
import static org.mockito.Matchers.anyLong;
import static org.mockito.Matchers.anyVararg; // not needed - replaced by any()
```

by these lines: 

```java
import static org.mockito.ArgumentMatchers.any;
import static org.mockito.ArgumentMatchers.anyLong;
```

### Second, you will update API of doAnswer

Was:

```java
when(userDeviceService.save(any(UserDevice.class)))
    .then(invocation -> invocation.getArgumentAt(0, UserDevice.class));
```

Now:

```java
when(userDeviceService.save(any()))
    .then(invocationOnMock -> invocationOnMock.getArgument(0));
```

(`getArgumentAt` -> `getArgument`, remove the class)

### Third, you update API of isMock

Was:

```java
import org.mockito.internal.util.MockUtil;

assertFalse(new MockUtil().isMock(expected));
```

Now:

```java
import static org.mockito.internal.util.MockUtil.isMock;

assertFalse(isMock(expected));
```

The last version is really better, don't you think?
No need to create an unused object. 




## What problems you will experience

Some of your tests will break when you upgrade to Mockito 2.1.
Below you will find some of the reasons. 



### 1) Matcher `any()` does not match `null` anymore

This code worked before:

```java
doNothing().when(service).calculateAmounts(any(BigDecimal.class), anyString());
```

But doesn't work anymore, if some of parameters are `null`.
Yes, my friend! You will need to rework **all your tests** that pass `null` 
instead of realistic value.
 
And it's great, because the new code is really better:

```java
doNothing().when(service).calculateAmounts(order.amount, order.currency);
```

Or this way:

```java
doNothing().when(service).calculateAmounts(new BigDecimal("100.00"), "EEK");
```

If you really need to pass `null` parameter, you can still do it. 
Just pass null explicitly using `isNull` matcher:

```java
doNothing().when(service).calculateAmounts(any(BigDecimal.class), isNull());
```



### 2) Matcher anyInt() does not match long anymore

This code worked with Mockito 1.x, but fails with Mockito 2.x:

```java
when(mqService.send(anyString(), anyInt())).thenReturn("transfer-ref");
```

You need to replace `anyInt()` by `anyLong()` for Mockito 2.1:

```java
 when(mqService.send(anyString(), anyLong())).thenReturn("transfer-ref");
```

Yes, my friend. You will need to rework **all your tests** that pass `int` instead of `long` etc.
But it's great, don't you think?
Because these tests were **inaccurate**.




### 3) You will discover bad tests

Yes, my friend. You will discover lot of bad lines among your tests. Just bad.
Like this one:

```java
@Test
public void checkMoratoriumRunsSilentlyWhenNoMoratorium() {
  doReturn("false").when(service).parseMoratoriumMessage(any(Mandate.class), any(LoanApplication.class));
  ...
  service.checkForMoratorium(any(Mandate.class), any(LoanApplication.class)); // WHAAAAAAAT?
  ...
}
```

This code worked with Mockito 1.x. Suddenly.
But it fails with Mockito 2.1 - and it's great, don't you think?

Obviously, we should use `mock` instead of `any` in the second line:

```java
service.checkForMoratorium(mock(Mandate.class), mock(LoanApplication.class));
```

By the way, even better solution is to avoid both `mock` and `any` and just create plain objects:

```java
service.checkForMoratorium(new Mandate(), new LoanApplication());
```

### 4) You will discover a lot of sloppy tests

... that check only **some** parameters and don't discover that others are `null`.

For example:

```java
doReturn(user).when(loginService).tokenLogin(eq("bob"), eq("login-key"), anyString());
    
security.login("bob", "login-key", null);
```

As you see, tests passes `null` parameter in the second line. And only `null`!
I discovered that there was no test that would pass something different from `null` there.

Mockito 2.1 will fail with such a sloppy test, because `anyString()` matcher doesn't allow `null` anymore.

The newer test that works with Mockito 2.1 is actually more precise:

```java
    request.remoteAddress = "127.0.0.2";
    doReturn(user).when(loginService).tokenLogin("bob", "login-key", "127.0.0.2");
    ...
```

You see it? You don't need all these obscure `eq` and `anyString`. Much better!

### 5) You will discover mystical red tests

You will find some red tests for which it's really hard to understand why they fail.

For example:

```java
@Test
public void requestByReferenceNumberNeverCreatesSubscription() {
  RequestByReferenceNumber requestByReferenceNumber = new RequestByReferenceNumber(user, "12345678901234567890");
  when(gisgmpService.request(any(RequestByDrivingLicense.class))).thenReturn(requestByReferenceNumber);

  GISGMP.requestCharges("12345678901234567890");
  ...
```

It took quite a long time to solve this issue. 
I could not find out why this test started to fail with Mockito 2.

Please note the second line. Obviously authors wanted to write 
 `any(RequestByReferenceNumber.class)` instead of `any(RequestByDrivingLicense.class)` 
 (they both inherit the same superclass).

It seems to be a bug of Mockito 1: it allowed using `any(AWrongClass.class)`,
and this incorrect test have been green for several years. :(

### 6) You will find out that anyList() and anyCollection() are now different things

For example, this code worked with Mockito 1:

```java
  @Test
  public void domesticPaymentInForeignCurrencyCanBeEnabled() {
    doCallRealMethod().when(Payments.accountService).forOperation(anyList(), eq(DOMESTIC));

    Collection<Account> accounts = ...
    
    return accountService.forOperation(accounts, DOMESTIC);
```

Note that mock in the first line uses `anyList()`, but the code 
actually passes variable `accounts` of type `Collection` (thought it's actually List).

Mockito 2 doesn't allow it anymore. You need to mock more precisely using `anyCollection()`.



## And you will be happy

To summarize: you will see a lot of pain, but you will become happy.
The tests got better, the world got lighter. 

Peace 2.1.0!
